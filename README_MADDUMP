1) Process Output 

The plugin add a new output option to mg5_aMC. After generating the process,
give the command:
output maddump dir_proc
to output the process in the directory "dir_proc".
Do not launch the generation of events and exit from mg5_aMC.


2) Input data for DM pdf

The user must supply the input data file for the flux (in energy-angle) of
the incoming DM particles in the dir_proc/Cards process subdirectory.
Two input files are needed:

a) "ehist.dat", which contains a weighted histogram of the 1D energy
   distribution (after the integration in the angular variable).
   The format is as follows:

headpoint     endpoint	     height 	  weight
   for each bin of the histogram.

b) "cell_fortran.dat", which contains the result of the fitting procedure
   given by the CellHistogram class in meshfitter2D.py.

The template python script lhe-fitmesh.py is available for the case the flux
of incoming particles has to be inferred from a LHE-file of scattering events.
The user must supply the following basic input parameters at the beginning
of the script source code:
- pdg code of the DM particle;
- the name of the LHE-file events;
- detector particle type: electron, proton.
Furthermore, the user can supply an efficiency function which is related to
the particular experimental setup overwriting the function
eff_function.
The default value is set to 1, which corresponds to an hermetic ideal detector.
The script updates in an automatic way the Run Card parameter, so that the user
can safetely skip the next step (3). 

3) Run Card parameters
The user must supply the following parameters:
lpp2 for detector particle pdf: 0 (electron), 1(proton)
ebeam 1: maximun energy of DM flux
ebeam 2: mass of the detector particle
By default, all the cuts have been removed.


4) Generation of events
Use the usual generation command
./bin/generate_events
