example: input commands files

To run: copy the XXX_cmd file in the main madgraph
directory and give the command:

./bin/maddump.py ./XXX_cmd


Remark: for dark photons produced in pion decay
before running the main script, 
- extract the DM_meson_2.tgz file and put it
  inside the models/ directory
- modify the import_events line in the pion_decay_DP_cmd
  for the correct path to the input pion events file,
  with .hepmc or .lhe extensions  
  (for testing purposes, you can use the 'example_MesonFlux.hepmc'
  file)
